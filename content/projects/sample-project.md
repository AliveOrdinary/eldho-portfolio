  ## Project Overview

  This project involved creating a complete brand identity for a tech startup focused on sustainable solutions. The goal was to design a modern, clean visual identity that communicated innovation and environmental responsibility.

  The scope included logo design, color palette selection, typography guidelines, and various brand applications including business cards, letterheads, and digital assets.

  ## Process

  The design process began with extensive research into the sustainability and technology sectors, followed by numerous sketching sessions and digital explorations. We developed several concepts before refining the chosen direction.

  The final identity uses a combination of geometric shapes and organic elements to reflect the client's focus on technology and nature.
